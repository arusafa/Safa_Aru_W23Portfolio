                <h4>Dear Hiring Manager,</h4>
                <small className="text-light">
                  I am writing to express my interest in the Front-End Developer
                  position at your company. With a strong passion for designing
                  and building beautiful and functional websites, I am confident
                  that my skills and experience will make me a valuable addition
                  to your team. As a recent graduate of George Brown College
                  with an Advanced Diploma in Computer Science, I have gained
                  extensive knowledge in advanced database development,
                  object-oriented programming, web application development, data
                  structures and algorithms, and system analysis, design, and
                  testing. Throughout my college career, I have used various
                  programming languages and templating engines such as Java, C#,
                  PHP, JavaScript, Spring Boot, and .NET to develop over 100
                  views for products, landing pages, admin dashboards, and more.
                  I have also developed reusable code using design principles
                  such as OOP and MVC, for more than 30 websites. In my previous
                  work experience, I applied all design concepts, including OOP,
                  MVC, and SOLID, as best practices in the current development
                  stage. I also utilized Agile methodologies to organize tasks
                  and manage control flow for over 60 projects. Additionally, I
                  developed various systems in isolated focus to backend
                  functioning to compute efficiently CRUD operations in various
                  environments using databases. I analyzed, evaluated, and
                  developed new web and database applications with C#, IIS, and
                  SQL SERVER. Moreover, I have gained experience in developing
                  and implementing a range of projects during my time at George
                  Brown College, including an online tutoring web and mobile
                  application, an online food finder application, a CRUD
                  application software employee management system, a system of
                  sports administration and technical support, a GUI-based
                  address book CRUD application, a CRUD application software
                  accounting management system, an airport booking system, and
                  an administration system for retail stores. I am proficient in
                  a range of programming languages, including Spring Boot, PHP,
                  JavaScript, C#, Python, HTML/CSS, and Java. I am also skilled
                  in using Nodejs, React, and React Native. Furthermore, I am
                  fluent in Turkish and English and have received certificates
                  of achievement, including The Dean's Honour List at George
                  Brown College in February 2022 and 2023 and General Arts and
                  Science English for Academic Purposes with Honours from Humber
                  College. I am excited about the opportunity to bring my skills
                  and experience to your team and contribute to the development
                  of high-quality web applications. Thank you for considering my
                  application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my
                  qualifications further.  <br />Sincerely,&nbsp;Safa Aru
